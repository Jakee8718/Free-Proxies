## 📄 Information

```yaml
These proxies are not owned by me. All proxies may have different respond time and some could potentially be offline.
You may test these proxies on your own as this is just a quick way to get a list of proxies.
The proxies may not be super secure, so please be responsible for what you do.
I am NOT responsible for what you do or what happens with these proxies, please be responsible.
